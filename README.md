ReadableJS is a toolkit for teachers to craft small demos that can be explored interactively.

It started as a rewrite of https://github.com/fullstackio/choc


## Development

Check that your Node version support NPM workspaces.
This use NPM workspaces. `npm i` on root, maybe on each package inside `packages` ?
build the lib, and build the editor next.
run editor public/index.html with your IDE (I use Webstorm) (or use serve package or something)
Check the Readme of each package, there are some extra manual instructions.
